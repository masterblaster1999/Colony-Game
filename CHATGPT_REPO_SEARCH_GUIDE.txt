CHATGPT_REPO_SEARCH_GUIDE.txt
Version: 1.0

PURPOSE
- This file is a navigation + prompt guide for AI assistants (ChatGPT) to understand this repository fast.
- IMPORTANT: Committing this file does NOT grant ChatGPT access to the repo.
  To let ChatGPT search/read this repo, you must connect GitHub in ChatGPT and authorize this repository.

HOW TO MAKE THIS REPO SEARCHABLE IN CHATGPT (REQUIRED)
1) In ChatGPT: Settings → (Connected apps / Connectors) → GitHub → Connect
2) Authorize GitHub and allow access to THIS repository (or the org containing it)
3) Back in chat, ask questions like:
   - "Search my GitHub repo for where <feature> is implemented."
   - "Find the code path that handles <X> and explain it."
   - "List the key modules involved in <system> and their responsibilities."

NOTES / LIMITATIONS (GOOD TO KNOW)
- The GitHub connector works by forming search queries from your prompt and retrieving relevant code/docs.
- If a repo doesn't appear, it may not be indexed by GitHub yet. Triggering a GitHub search can help indexing.

REPO SUMMARY (FILL THIS IN)
- What this project does:
  <one paragraph>

- Primary language(s) / platform(s):
  <e.g., C++23 on Windows, etc.>

- How to build/run (very short):
  <commands or steps>

- Coding conventions / architecture style:
  <bullets>

"START HERE" ENTRY POINTS (FILL THIS IN)
- README:
  <path>
- Main entrypoint / app bootstrap:
  <path(s)>
- Build system:
  <path(s)>
- Core modules:
  <path(s)>
- Tests / tools:
  <path(s)>

DIRECTORY MAP (FILL THIS IN)
- /src (or equivalent):
  - responsibility:
- /include:

- /assets:

AI TASK SHORTCUTS (COPY/PASTE PROMPTS)
- Bug hunt:
  "Search this repo for <error text or symbol>. Identify the root cause and propose a minimal patch."

- Refactor safely:
  "Find all call sites of <function/class>. Propose a refactor plan with step-by-step patches and tests."

- Architecture overview:
  "Trace the execution from <entrypoint> through <major subsystem>. Summarize data flow and ownership."

- Build help:
  "Inspect build scripts and dependencies. Suggest fixes for <build error> and explain why."

OPTIONAL: KEEP AN UP-TO-DATE FILE LIST (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
- Generate a file list on Windows (PowerShell):
  git ls-files | Sort-Object | Out-File -Encoding utf8 REPO_FILE_LIST.txt

- Generate a quick tree (PowerShell):
  tree /f /a > REPO_TREE.txt

Add those generated files to the repo if you want the AI (and humans) to quickly see what's there.
