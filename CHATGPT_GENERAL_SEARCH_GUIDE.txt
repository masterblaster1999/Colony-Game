CHATGPT_GENERAL_SEARCH_GUIDE.txt
Version: 1.0

PURPOSE
This file is a “how to search my repo” operating guide for GPT-5.2 Pro (or any AI assistant)
WITHOUT GitHub connector access.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION
You can only read/search files that I explicitly provide in this chat (upload/paste).
This guide assumes I will upload my repo as “raw text bundles” (e.g., BUNDLE_part001.txt …).

EXPECTED INPUT FILES (UPLOAD THESE TO CHATGPT)
1) BUNDLE_part001.txt ... BUNDLE_partNNN.txt
   - Each bundle contains many files wrapped in BEGIN/END markers.
2) REPO_FILE_LIST.txt (optional but strongly recommended)
   - Quick index of all exported files (path + size + modified).
3) MANIFEST.json (optional but helpful)
   - Hashes and metadata for verification / tracking.

BUNDLE FORMAT (WHAT TO LOOK FOR)
Each file in the bundle is delimited like:

===== BEGIN FILE: <relative/path> | bytes=<n> | sha256=<hash> =====
<file contents...>
===== END FILE: <relative/path> =====

SEARCH + READING PROTOCOL (GENERAL SEARCH)
Follow this process whenever asked to “search the project”:

PHASE 1 — BUILD A MENTAL INDEX (FAST)
A) Read REPO_FILE_LIST.txt first (if provided).
   - Infer folder structure and likely entrypoints.
B) Skim the bundle headers (BEGIN FILE lines) to learn:
   - languages, build system, main modules, tests, tools, assets.

PHASE 2 — TARGETED SEARCH (FAST THEN DEEP)
A) Start with broad keyword search across bundles:
   - exact symbol (e.g., "DeviceResources", "WorldGen")
   - error text (e.g., "vcpkg install failed")
   - common synonyms (e.g., "init", "bootstrap", "startup")
B) Narrow by path when possible:
   - include/core/*
   - src/render/*
   - tools/*
C) Once matches found:
   - open the specific file(s) and read locally around the match
   - identify definitions vs. references
   - extract call chains and config interactions

PHASE 3 — CONNECT THE DOTS (TRACE)
When asked “how does X work?”:
A) Identify entrypoint(s): main/app/bootstrap/launcher
B) Find the first call into subsystem X
C) Follow:
   - interface → implementation
   - factory/registration → runtime selection
   - config → build flags → runtime toggles
D) Track data ownership:
   - who allocates / frees
   - who owns pointers/resources
   - threading expectations

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (HOW TO RESPOND)
When answering, ALWAYS provide:
1) File path(s)
2) What was found there (definition / call site / config / data structure)
3) A short excerpt (only what is needed; do NOT dump entire files)
4) A clear next-step list (what to inspect next / what change to make)

RESPONSE TEMPLATE (USE THIS STRUCTURE)
- Findings
  - <path>: <what it is> (definition / usage)
    Excerpt:
      <few lines>
  - <path>: <what it is>
    Excerpt:
      <few lines>

- Interpretation
  - <explain how the pieces connect>

- Next steps
  1) <action>
  2) <action>

QUERY LANGUAGE / SEARCH TRICKS
Use these patterns for robust “general search”:
- Exact string: "SymbolName"
- Case-insensitive guess: try "symbolname" and "SymbolName"
- Related terms: search both "init" and "initialize", "config" and "settings"
- Path filter: prioritize matches in:
  - CMakeLists.txt / *.cmake for build issues
  - include/ for public APIs
  - src/ or core/ for implementations
  - tests/ for usage examples

COMMON TASK PLAYBOOKS

1) “Where is X defined?”
- Search for: "class X", "struct X", "X::", "typedef X", "using X"
- Return:
  - canonical definition file
  - forward decls (if relevant)
  - primary include path

2) “Find all call sites of function F”
- Search for: "F(" plus "Class::F(" if method
- Summarize call sites by module/folder
- If too many, group by directory and show top 10 most relevant.

3) “Trace the execution path for feature Y”
- Start from entrypoint
- Find the first reference to Y
- Walk outward/inward along calls until:
  - configuration → init → runtime update loop → rendering/output

4) “Fix this build error”
- Search for the exact error line first
- Then search for the failing target/package in:
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - vcpkg manifests
  - CI configs
- Propose smallest patch first.

SCALING RULES (BIG REPOS / MANY BUNDLES)
- Prefer file-path narrowing early.
- Prefer “definition first, then call sites”.
- Avoid dumping entire files; quote only the necessary excerpt.
- If the question is broad, produce:
  - quick map of relevant files
  - then ask the user to choose which sub-area to go deep on (only if required).
  (Otherwise proceed with best guess and state assumptions.)

PRIVACY / SECRETS SAFETY
- If you encounter content that looks like secrets (tokens, private keys, passwords):
  - Do NOT reproduce the secret value.
  - Replace with [REDACTED] in excerpts.
  - Recommend removing/rotating secrets and adding to .gitignore.

CONFIRMATION CHECK (BEFORE FINAL ANSWER)
- Did you cite file paths for every key claim?
- Did you distinguish “definition” vs “usage”?
- Did you avoid excessive copying?
- Did you provide concrete next steps?
